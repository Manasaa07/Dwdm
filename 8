Given data

ar_speeds <- c(78.3, 81.8, 82, 74.2, 83.4, 84.5, 82.9, 77.5, 80.9, 70.6)

Calculate the interquartile range (IQR) qr_car_speeds <- IQR(car_speeds)

Calculate the standard deviation

d_car_speeds <- sd(car_speeds)

Print the results

at("Interquartile range (IQR) of car speeds:\n")

erquartile range (IQR) of car speeds: rint(igr_car_speeds)

at("Standard deviation of car speeds:\n")

ndard deviation of car speeds: rint(sd_car_speeds)
